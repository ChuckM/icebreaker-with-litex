# This is a module definition for the 1BitSquared 7 segment display
# PMOD that has two 7 segment displays. Of course the PMOD port only
# has 8 GPIO lines so how does it work? Well pin 7 (the eight bit) controls
# which of the two displays are active. So to have "both" displays lit at
# the "same" time, you have to multiplex them and so that is what this
# module does.
#

#
# Note it is mostly a migen module not a part of Litex but we are attaching
# it to a Litex platform. Separating this is another exercise for later.

		allowances for invoking either one. When you instantiate it
		you need to pass it the platform (type Platform()), the PMOD
		you are using (string), and an 8 wire Signal for the 'value'
		which is displayed on the display.

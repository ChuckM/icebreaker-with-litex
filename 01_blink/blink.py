# Super trivial litex example, to get a feel for the flow

# Not a lot of useful stuff here feel free to use it how you would like.
#
# Step one, import all the things from Migen ...
#
from migen import *

# Step two, import the base Platform class from Litex
from litex.build.generic_platform import *

# Step three, import a 'build flow' for the FPGA on the platform.
# In the case of the icebitsy it is a Lattice ICE40KUP5 so we import
# "Lattice" build flow which uses the YosysHQ tools.
from litex.build.lattice import LatticePlatform

#
# Step four here is building a "platform" (note that Litex-boards already
# has a definition for this board, but I wanted to see what was inside
# the derivative platform class)
# 
# First up is Input / Output
#
# This is an array of defines which tell Litex things about the board.
# In this case, the clock line, two user controllable LEDs, and a
# user accessible push button. In an HDL flow this would be like the
# user constraints file, but in Litex it is an array of I/Os in an
# array cleverly named "_io"
#
# Each tuple in this list defines a 'Signal()' which is the Migen class
# that wires things together. The first element of this tuple is a user
# defined name which you can use later to "wire up" this signal to your
# design. The second element is how many (zero based) of these there are.
#
# What that means is that you can define both LEDs that are part of the
# board as "user_led" but one would be number '0' and one would be number
# '1'. However, in my platform file I'm identifying them by their color (red
# or green) because that is an easier way to get the "correct" one.
#
# The third element of this tuple are the "pin" (or pins) associated with
# this I/O. It is defined by the Migen 'Pin()' function.
#
# If there is more than one pin associated with an I/O then its
# 'shape' is size 'n' (based on the number of pins). If you look at the
# board definition provided by the litex-boards repo you can see that
# a pin can also be a 'SubSignal' which allows you to refer to elements
# by name. I use this capability in the cylon example.
#
# The last element of this tuple are the IO Voltage levels, these are
# predefined by Migen, so in our case LVCMOS33 is a 3.3V low voltage
# CMOS pin.
#
#
_io = [
	# Clock (which is 12 MHz on the standard board)
	("clk12mhz", 0, Pins("35"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),

	# LEDs on the Icebreaker PMOD board.
	# One is red, and four of them are green
	("user_led_red", 0, Pins("26"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),
	# Green LEDs are defined as a 4 bit wide signal 
	("user_led_green", 0, Pins("27 25 21 23"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),

	# The "user" buttons  
	("user_button_1", 0, Pins("20"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),
	("user_button_2", 0, Pins("19"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),
	("user_button_3", 0, Pins("18"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),
]

#
# Now that we have the I/Os defined we can construct a subclass
# of the Litex Platform class for this board.
#
# We subclass "LatticePlatform" because it has the build flow for the
# Lattice FPGA we are using, so the class hierarchy is
# 		Platform-> LatticePlatform -> Icebreaker

# And now the "design" (sort of like the 'behavioural' clause of VHDL)
#
# First off create a Platform instance ...
#
icebreaker = Icebreaker()

#
# Now we define a module that is a "blinker" (basically an LED, a
# counter/divider, and a clock source). We'll see later that this is
# also the "top" module that you would create if you were using an HDL
# tool like Quartus or Vivado.
#
# The interesting thing for me is that all of the heavy lifting goes
# on in the __init__ method. This defines the modules "wires" which
# are the equivalent in Verilog or VHDL as the module's inputs and
# outputs. 
#
# UNLIKE HDL, the clock domain here is implicit rather than being
# explicit. All modules are presumed to be connected to the default
# clock of the plaform and that is the clock that drives the
# 'sync' blocks. We "request" the LED resources
# and in this case we ask for them both.
#
# It is possible to create additional clock domains but that is not
# needed for this simple example.

Very 'simple' Blinker
---------------------

This example/test was created to see if I even understood what was going
on with LiteX. The enjoy-digital folks are really cool but their documentation
leaves a bit to be desired so there was some experiementation here to get
to this point.

A very good reference for the Migen "FHDL" language is 
located at [https://m-labs.hk/migen/manual/](https://m-labs.hk/migen/manual/).

See comments in the source code `blinky.py` for what is going on here.
